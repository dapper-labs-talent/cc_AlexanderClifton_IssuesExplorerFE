# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

- I'm assuming that working with the GithubAPI will probably give me the most confusing moments. Everything else I can already see my mind around.

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?

- dark mode :)... that'll be a stretch goal

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

- 1 - Allow users to "tag" a issue as important, and create a new clickable element for "View All Important". If this data was available on app-reload, then you now have something that is much more useful to a user.

- 2 - Allow user on-button-click to create a png of the issue, convert it to .STL format and email the file to a 3dprinting house. You now added significant value by... wait.. what? Why would anyone want a 3D printed description of a github issue😊? ok that one was silly. I digress...

- 3 - You could break down the regular /issues route on github. Piece by piece..., whatever info you can get from the api, we could pull into our own app. Filter by author, assignees, etc...

Wait why are we doing this again? Why not just use the real github ui? Now I think the most significant value I could add to the project would be making the argument that this repo is not needed. It doesn't serve a use-case and I think the team should pivot.
If I'm right, then I've probably added more company value than any feature I could have coded.

### Looking Back

> Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.

-

> How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

-

> If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

-

> Did you learn anything new?

-

> Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

-

> Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?
